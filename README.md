# LDS-Legal-Document-Summarization-
Pending cases have long been an issue in Indian courts. There are around 4 crore unresolved cases. Due to the exponential growth of information, it has become necessary to create systems that make it easy for both legal experts and regular citizens to access pertinent legal information. For legal stakeholders, manually summarizing hundreds of papers is a tiresome and time- consuming operation. As machine learning has advanced, numerous cutting-edge models for text summarization have been developed. Legal writings don't work well with domain-independent models, and optimizing those models for the Indian legal datasets that aren't enough publicly accessible, is a concern for the judicial system. In order to overcome the aforementioned issues, we have worked on an automated system that can accurately and efficiently summarize legal documents by utilizing natural language processing techniques. This work begins with a general introduction to text summarizing.
